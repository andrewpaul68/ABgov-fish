Pembina Analysis.

This directory has an example of a trend power/sample size analysis on
the Pembina System.

Here are the modifications made for this system

(a) Copied over the power.trend.template.r and functions.r to this directory.

(b) Modified power.trend.template.r to add the system name “Pembina”.

(c) The 20013 data is NOT in the FWIS format. I created a file that was in 
the FWIS format and copied over the data as best I could. There could be errors.

(c) Modified the list of file names for the workbooks

(d) Changed the selection of “Float” for the equipment type.
